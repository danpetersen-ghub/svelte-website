# Creating a Svelte Component

Svelte components are a powerful way to reuse code and build modular, reusable UI elements. Here's how to create a Svelte component:

## Step 1: Create a new file

Create a new file with a .svelte extension in your project's src directory. This will be the file for your Svelte component.

## Step 2: Define the component's template

Inside your new file, define the template for your component using Svelte's template syntax. This template can include HTML elements, bindings, and other Svelte features.

Here's an example template for a simple button component:

        <button class="btn">
        {label}
        </button>

## Step 3: Define the component's script

Inside your new file, define the script for your component using JavaScript. This script can include logic, event handlers, and other functionality.

Here's an example script for the button component:

        export let label = 'Click me';

        $: fullLabel = `Button: ${label}`;

        function handleClick() {
        console.log('Button was clicked!');
        }

## Step 4: Define the component's style

Inside your new file, you can also define the style for your component using CSS. This style will only be applied to elements within the component.

Here's an example style for the button component:

            .btn {
            background-color: #4caf50;
            color: white;
            padding: 12px 24px;
            border: none;
            cursor: pointer;
            font-size: 16px;
            border-radius: 4px;
            }

            .btn:hover {
            background-color: #46a049;
            }

## Step 5: Use the component in your app

To use your new component in your Svelte app, simply import it and add it to your app's template like any other element:

            <!-- MyApp.svelte -->

            <script>
            import MyButton from './MyButton.svelte';
            </script>

            <MyButton label="Click me" />

And that's it! You now have a reusable Svelte component that you can use throughout your app.ÃŸ
